Scripts for Sony Vegas that may assist in YTPMV or other video creation

Installation: 
  1. Place desired scripts into your Vegas Script Menu folder (usually C:/Program Files/VEGAS/VEGAS Pro 1X.0/Script Menu)  
2. In Vegas, click Tools > Scripting > Rescan Script Menu  
3. Bind script to a hotkey. Options > Customize Keyboard > Show commands containing: type the name of the script (i.e. bulk update pitching mode.js) > press hotkeys > Click "Add" > Click "OK"  


## bulk update pitching mode
   **NOTE: while pitching events in Vegas, you should always have extra labels on (Control + Shift +I). This lets you visually see the amount of steps an event is pitched.**
   
Creates a hotkey that allows you to scroll through pitching modes on audio events.
The modes are as follows:  
- Efficient  
- Pro  
- Pro (Preserve Formants)  
- Soloist (Monophonic)  
- Soloist (Speech)  
	
Different pitching modes have differing effects depending on the type of audio, whether it is pitched up or down, and how it is stretched. Try them all and see which works better for your situation.
